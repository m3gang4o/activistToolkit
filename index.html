    <h3>Hundreds of Asian-American hate crimes have taken place in the past year. Thousands of Asian-Americans have expressed their feelings of unsafety in public spaces. We must act to prevent these incidents and create a safespace for people of all races. The more we speak up, the more we can educate on better behavior. </h3> //description of problem
